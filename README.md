# us-states-game
This game is displays the USA map without showing state names. The player has to type the name of us states in the input box one by one. If the user types the correct state his score gets incremented and corresponding state is displayed on map. This game helps in memorising the locations and name of the USA states. This project uses panda library to convert the state CSV data into python lists. It uses turtle library to display map and state names.
